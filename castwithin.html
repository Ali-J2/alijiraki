									<h3 class="major">Development</h3>
									<p>Dungeons of Legend: Cast Within and is a 3D re-imagining of DoL: Underwell, my first solo Unity project. This too was a solo project, and I was responsible for mapping out levels, enemy AI, combat, puzzles, creating marketing materials, and just the entire process of getting a game from zero to shipped. Looking back on it with all the experience I have now, I can see it's missing a lot of "juice" and things that would greatly improve game feel. Never the less, it was a huge learning experience not just in game programming, but also in marketing and just getting a feel for how games are launched on Steam.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Enemy Design</h3>
											<p>Many enemies were setup using a combination of Synty models and Mixamo animations.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Dungeons</h3>
											<p>These were mapped out on graph paper, and then a lot of effort went into making them look as nice as possible while also giving that old school dungeon crawler feel.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Traps and Environmental Hazards</h3>
											<p>One of the funner aspects of designing levels was filling them with traps that were a danger to friend and foe alike.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Environmental Story Telling</h3>
											<p>There was a humble effort to tell a story via the runes written on walls as well as environmental props/settings that gave an idea of which character lived where.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Puzzles and Riddles</h3>
											<p>I really enjoyed making devious puzzles accompanied by riddles and small poems that gave hints as to how some of these were solved. At the beginning puzzles were simple, later on some more complex logic based puzzles like knights and knaves were introduced.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Launch Trailer</h3>
											<p>This was the trailer used to market the game; at the time, I used Davinci Resolve to make this.</p>
